## Description

Our project utilizes the power of OpenGL and Code::Blocks to create a captivating scene inspired by movie scenes. The centerpiece of the scene is a moving car and a tower featuring a hanging wall hour (time) that functions perfectly. By working on this project, we have gained a deeper understanding of computer graphics principles, including the use of primitives and other techniques.

## Features

- Moving car animation
- Tower with a hanging wall hour (time) that functions accurately
